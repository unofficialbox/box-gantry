# 📔 box-gantry — Decision Records

Numbering starts at **D-101**. D-001…D-013, cited throughout
[`NEW_ENGINE_REQUIREMENTS.md`](./NEW_ENGINE_REQUIREMENTS.md), refer to
box-codegen's decision records (consultable prior art in that repository).

Template: Context → Decision → Consequences. Status is one of
proposed / accepted / superseded-by-D-nnn.

## D-101 — Implement the engine in Rust

**Status:** accepted · 2026-07-10

**Context:** The generator's daily activity is pattern-matching over IR
nodes across three backend lowerings. The dominant failure mode of the
predecessor engine was the silent miss (assessment §2, §6).

**Decision:** The engine is written in Rust. The IR is a closed set of
enums; lowerings use exhaustive `match`, so an unhandled node shape is a
compile error, not a runtime pass-through.

**Consequences:** Single-binary distribution; `serde` for spec parsing;
`miette`-style diagnostics for spec-located errors; the engine's own
serde-tagged enums double as the reference design for the Rust SDK's
`oneOf` modeling. TypeScript's salvage/speed advantage is forgone
deliberately (assessment §6, runner-up analysis).

## D-102 — box-codegen is consultable prior art, not a normative baseline

**Status:** accepted · 2026-07-10

**Context:** The project has zero existing users and zero obligations to
the six legacy SDK targets. Earlier drafts treated box-codegen as a frozen
reference whose artifacts (Go fixtures, output baseline) ported verbatim
and served as acceptance oracles.

**Decision:** box-codegen may be consulted — its designs, lessons (G-n),
decisions (D-00n), test semantics, and spec-quirk knowledge inform this
project — but nothing is ported verbatim, and **no acceptance criterion
references box-codegen's code or output**. Correctness is defined by the
capability contract (requirements R§1), each target language's toolchain,
and the round-trip / conformance / live-smoke suites (VR-3, VR-4, VR-7).

**Consequences:** TR-Go.6's oracle is the VR-3 conformance checklist (the
old Go output is at most an informal comparison); VR-2 fixtures are
authored fresh against the new IR; completion credit in the requirements
roll-up reflects consultable designs (🔶), never portable code.

## D-103 — Target order: Go → Apex → Rust, with Apex designed-for from day one

**Status:** accepted · 2026-07-10

**Context:** The three targets are near-opposite extremes; Apex is the
stress test (no modules, no generics, governor limits, mandatory test
coverage — assessment §4).

**Decision:** Ship Go first (proven design, cheapest verification loop),
Apex second, Rust third — but bake Apex's constraints into the IR and
manifests during engine development, and validate them early with a
timeboxed throwaway Apex spike (PLAN.md M3.5) rather than waiting for v2.

**Consequences:** The IR models rich concepts (modules, generics-shaped
containers) that Apex lowers away; manifest axes for generics, callout
limits, and coverage mandates exist from M2; the spike's IR pressure is
reviewed explicitly so Apex limitations never silently reshape the IR
(assessment §8).

## D-104 — `x-box-tag` is the manager grouping key; `tags` is display-only

**Status:** accepted · 2026-07-11

**Context:** Manager grouping (FR-7.1) needs a machine-readable key on
every operation. The vendored real specs show `tags` is a display concern:
at least one operation (`get_enterprise_configurations_id_v2025.0`) has no
`tags` at all but does carry `x-box-tag`. Every operation in all three
documents (base 2024.0, 2025.0, 2026.0) carries a non-empty `x-box-tag`,
and `operationId` is unique per document.

**Decision:** Ingestion groups operations by `x-box-tag` and treats a
missing/empty `x-box-tag` or `operationId` as a loud ingestion error
(FR-1.4) — an operation that cannot be grouped or named must fail the run,
never be skipped (NF-1). `tags` is not consumed.

**Consequences:** `gantry-spec` validates both invariants on every load;
the real-spec integration test pins the current counts (296/37/3
operations, 73 managers in base). `operationId`s carrying the
`#variation` suffix (19 in the base spec) are a spec-authoring convention
that the naming layer (FR-1.2) must translate into structured variation
data — the `#` never survives into an IR identifier ([`Identifier`]
rejects it).
